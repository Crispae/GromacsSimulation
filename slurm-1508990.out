Dynamic load balancing report:
 DLB was off during the run due to low measured imbalance.
 Average load imbalance: 27.2%.
 The balanceable part of the MD step is 54%, load imbalance is computed from this.
 Part of the total run time spent waiting due to load imbalance: 14.7%.
 Average PME mesh/force load: 1.277
 Part of the total run time spent waiting due to PP/PME imbalance: 14.3 %

NOTE: 14.7 % of the available CPU time was lost due to load imbalance
      in the domain decomposition.
      Dynamic load balancing was automatically disabled, but it might be beneficial to manually tuning it on (option -dlb on.)
      You can also consider manually changing the decomposition (option -dd);
      e.g. by using fewer domains along the box dimension in which there is
      considerable inhomogeneity in the simulated system.
NOTE: 14.3 % performance was lost because the PME ranks
      had more work to do than the PP ranks.
      You might want to increase the number of PME ranks
      or increase the cut-off and the grid spacing.


NOTE: 6 % of the run time was spent communicating energies,
      you might want to increase some nst* mdp options
